# Web Development - Lesson 4
### Interactivity

## Resources
* [Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.4.html)
* [Leaflet tutorial](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/)

## Task
There is a lot of new code to digest in `main.js`. So the first step is taking some time to walk through the existing code and get a feel for it. After that make your way to the `FIXME` at the end and tackle the task there.

## Deliverable
After you are done:
 * Post a link to your forked repository on Canvas.
